# Web Scraper of Erasmus Internships
 
Used Libraries: 
* Pandas - It's used to save data. 
* Requests, BeautifulSoup - They're used for web scraping.  

In this project, internship adverts' data is extracted by web scrapping on the website which is mentioned above, and later it is stored as a CSV file. The data includes the duration of the internship, the title of the internship, the field of studies, the company's name and information, the deadline of application, duration, and location of the internship. 

The data which was extracted from https://erasmusintern.org/ is only used for educational purposes. 

There is an increase in demand fot getting data from the internet and these data can concern for different purposes. The problem is websites don't give you data you are looking for in CSV file. In this case you want to scrap data from the websites. Hence, I wanted to do such a project.
